#+TITLE: Category Theory for programmers - NOTES

* The essence of composition
A category consists of
+ Objects
+ Morphism (Arrows) that goes from one object to another

** Composition
Arrows can be composed

#BEGIN_SRC haskell
f :: A -> B

g :: B -> C

g . f -- This is the composition of two morphism
#END_SRC

Properties of composition:

+ Associative
  You don't need parenthesis
+ Identity
  Called Unit of composition, a morphism that loops on an object

  composing a function with an identiy result in the same function

  f :: A -> B

  Id_B . f  == f

  f . Id_A  == f
